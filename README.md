POSTGRESQL, nodejs, express, nginx, docker swarm, redis,raspberrypi


if you have docker installed you should be able to run the app, but you would have to inject the meaty/pi/*.csv in the database with the nodejs scripts somewhere.

i have passwords in the github repo but all my databases are behind a wall called local area network.

anyways pretty fun stuff.
